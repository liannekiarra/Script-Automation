University Module Name: Operating Systems
Project Name: Scripts and Automation Tool Development (Software Artefact)

Project Specification:

Write Bash Scripts to command the Operating System for a Linux machine. 
Bash scripts are written to perform operations on Linux OS.

The Administrative tasks that are to be automated relates to:

- User and Group Management
- File Management Script
- Resource Monitoring Script
- Process Management Script
- Backup and Recovery Script
- Performance Reporting Script

These scripts are written in Bash and are integrated with Python3 to
automate the tasks provided with a User Interface.

Conclusion:

These exercise/project explores how Bash Scripts can be used to automate tasks onto a Linux Machine to 
perform administrative tasks. Python3 is used to combine all scripts and also to provide a menu user interface 
for the administrator.

I encounter problems, since the project was done into a virtual machine instead of a real linux machine, tkinter 
and flask had problems running in Linux VMs , the user interface couldve been develoepd using these web development frameworks
to provide a more suitable User Interface. The file userInterface.html briefly shows an adequate representation of the user interface intended for
the Automation Development Project.
